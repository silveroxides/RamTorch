ramtorch.nvme_store
-------------------
File-backed master weights for the NVMe offload tier — pure PyTorch, no
cuFile/GDS or third-party wrappers.

:class:`NvmeTensorStore` reserves one contiguous region on disk (a single
file, page-aligned tensor slots) and exposes each tensor as a *view over an
mmap of that file* via ``torch.UntypedStorage.from_file(shared=True)``:

* Reads page-fault through the OS page cache: cold reads stream from the
  drive at disk speed, hot ones are served from RAM if the kernel has room —
  and get evicted under memory pressure, which is the scenario this tier
  exists for.
* In-place writes (an optimizer step on the mapped params) land in the page
  cache and are written back to the file lazily by the kernel — training
  works unchanged, no explicit read-modify-write cycle needed.
* The mapped tensors are ordinary CPU tensors to the rest of torch:
  ``state_dict()``, ``copy_``, optimizers, everything just works.

This is deliberately NOT GPUDirect Storage: the empirical contention test
(``examples/nvme_h2d_contention_test.py``) showed the disk->GPU path's
host->device hop serializes on the H2D copy engine anyway, so the honest
model — and the simple implementation — is disk -> pinned staging -> GPU on
the loader thread ("slower H2D", see ``ramtorch.offload_simulator``).

    Notes
    -----
    * One-shot: ``write`` lays out and fills the whole file once. The layout
      aligns every tensor to 4096 bytes (page-aligned; also O_DIRECT-friendly
      if the file is ever read by external tooling).
    * Durability is page-cache semantics: the kernel flushes dirty pages on
      its own schedule. This is scratch space for streaming masters, not a
      checkpoint format — keep using ``torch.save`` for checkpoints.
