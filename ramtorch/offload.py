ramtorch.offload
----------------
Windowed CPU->GPU layer-streaming executor ("sliding window + pinned layers").

The design was validated first in :mod:`ramtorch.offload_simulator`: weights
live in CPU pinned memory, a **loader thread** prefetches upcoming chunks into
a GPU window of ``window`` slots over a dedicated H2D stream, and ``pin``
evenly spaced chunks stay permanently on the GPU (they never load, never
evict, and ease PCIe traffic at the cost of their memory). Eviction is
farthest-next-use (Belady — optimal, since the itinerary is known). Total GPU
weight memory ~= ``window + pin`` chunks.

Gradient accumulation for streamed chunks (``grad_accum=``):

* ``"stream"`` (default): the accumulator itself streams like a weight. Each
  chunk's accumulated grad lives in exactly one place — "empty" (zeroed,
  nothing since the last flush), on the GPU (``acc_slots`` bounded slots,
  default = ``window``), or evicted to its pinned CPU buffer. Backward adds
  happen **on the GPU** on the compute stream; under slot pressure the
  accumulator is spilled D2H (a plain overwrite copy — zero CPU arithmetic)
  and reloaded H2D by the loader before that chunk's next backward (the
  itinerary marks which visits are backwards, so reloads prefetch like
  weights). ``flush_grads`` spills whatever is still on-GPU in one batch.
  With ``acc_slots >= streamed chunks`` accumulators never leave the GPU
  between flushes: grad PCIe traffic drops from once per microbatch to once
  per step.
* ``"cpu"`` (legacy): every microbatch's grads are copied D2H as a packet and
  a **writeback thread** adds them into the pinned CPU accumulators
  (``grad_acc += staging`` — host math, serialized per stage, and the reason
  compute-bound configs used to stall).

Optional third tier (``nvme=K`` / ``nvme_layers=...`` + ``nvme_path=``):
masters of the selected chunks move from CPU RAM to a file on disk, held as
mmap-backed tensors (:class:`ramtorch.nvme_store.NvmeTensorStore` — pure
PyTorch, no GDS). The loader stages them disk -> shared pinned buffer -> GPU
on its one thread, which is exactly the simulator's empirically validated
"slower H2D" model (the disk->GPU host hop serializes on the H2D copy engine
anyway — measured in ``examples/nvme_h2d_contention_test.py``). Placement
defaults to *interleaved* among the chunks (best in simulation: slow loads
spread out and hide behind neighboring compute). Optimizer steps update the
mapped masters in place; the kernel writes them back to disk lazily. Grad
accumulators for NVMe chunks still live in RAM (transient, one chunk's worth
of overlap at a time is what matters for streaming).

Model dicing follows the pipeline convention (``Pipeline(stage_modules=...)``)
rather than module surgery: you cut your own model into an ordered list of
chunk modules, each taking the previous chunk's output. This supersedes the
CUDA-stream-bouncing pattern in :mod:`ramtorch.modules.linear`
(``CPUBouncingLinear``), which is deprecated.

Concurrency style follows :mod:`ramtorch.pipeline_relay`: plain threads with
condition-variable handshakes; compute blocks only on "chunk not resident
yet", the loader blocks only on "no slot free / nothing to prefetch". CUDA
cross-stream safety uses the same event pattern as the relay mailboxes (the
producer records an event on its stream; the consumer's stream waits on it).

Autograd contract (mirrors the manual-autograd ``Stage``): backward walks
chunks in reverse (the simulator's training "echo": F0..F(n-1), B(n-1)..B0)
calling ``torch.autograd.grad`` per chunk. Two backward strategies:

* ``keep_activations=False`` (default, "recompute"): the training forward
  runs under ``no_grad`` caching only chunk-boundary activations; backward
  reloads each chunk and **recomputes its forward** (per-chunk gradient
  checkpointing). A naively retained graph would keep references to the
  streamed GPU weights and nothing would actually be freed between F_i and
  B_i — recompute sidesteps that entirely.
* ``keep_activations=True`` ("keep"): the forward builds each chunk's graph
  and keeps its internal activations, so backward skips the recompute. The
  graph's weight references point at stable per-chunk tensor objects whose
  **storage** is freed on eviction and refilled by the loader before that
  chunk's backward (``untyped_storage().resize_(0)``, the FSDP resharding
  trick) — so weights still stream despite the live graph. Costs activation
  memory for all chunks at once; also the correct mode for stochastic chunks
  (dropout), which recompute would resample.
* ``keep_activations="checkpoint"``: keep-mode plumbing (grad-enabled
  forward, stable graph tensors, storage free/refill) but each chunk runs
  under ``torch.utils.checkpoint`` (non-reentrant), so its internal
  activations are dropped and autograd recomputes them at backward —
  recompute-mode memory with checkpoint's RNG stash/restore, i.e. the
  dropout-safe recompute. NB: a bare ``torch.utils.checkpoint`` inside the
  user's chunk module breaks — by backward time ``functional_call`` has
  reverted the module's params to the CPU masters, so the recompute would
  read the wrong weights. To checkpoint *selected regions* of your own
  forward instead of whole chunks, use :func:`offload_checkpoint` (with
  ``keep_activations=True``).

Usage::

    chunks = [make_block(i) for i in range(24)]      # dice your own model
    model = OffloadModel(chunks, device="cuda:0", window=2, pin=6)

    out = model(x)                                    # streamed inference

    result = model.step(x, targets=y, loss_fn=F.cross_entropy)
    model.flush_grads()                               # acc -> .grad
    optimizer.step()                                  # CPU+GPU param groups

Notes
-----
* Chunks exchange a single tensor by default; a chunk may also return a
  TUPLE of tensors, whose elements become the next chunk's positional args
  (like the pipeline's tuple outputs). Non-float / no-grad elements (masks,
  position ids) pass through without gradients.
* Buffer mutations inside chunks (e.g. BatchNorm running stats) happen on the
  streamed GPU copy and are NOT written back; use eval-mode/buffer-free norms.
* The optimizer sees mixed devices: streamed params (and their grads) on CPU,
  pinned params on the GPU. torch optimizers handle per-param devices fine.
  For CPU params, a stochastic/fused CPU optimizer (e.g. ramtorch AdamW)
  keeps the step cheap.
* The engine's internal primitives (``_announce``/``_acquire``/``_release``,
  ``_call_chunk``, ``_grads_for``, ``_accumulate``) are also driven externally
  by :class:`ramtorch.pipeline_offload.OffloadStage`, which streams a pipeline
  stage's weights with the itinerary derived from the pipeline schedule
  instead of ``step()``'s fixed F/B echo. Treat their signatures as a shared
  contract when refactoring.

                 wins). Their weights are held as mmap-backed tensors in a
                 single scratch file and stream disk -> pinned staging -> GPU
                 on the loader thread ("slower H2D"). Saves CPU RAM at the
                 cost of load latency for those chunks. Optimizer steps
                 update the mapped masters in place (page-cache write-back).
                 Inference is ungated; TRAINING (the first :meth:`step`)
                 requires the sudoer + RAMTORCH_NVME_ACKNOWLEDGE=1 consent
                 gate because it rewrites the on-disk masters every
                 optimizer step (SSD wear — see docs/offload.md).
    nvme_layers: explicit chunk indices for the NVMe tier (overrides
                 ``nvme``).
    nvme_path  : path of the scratch weights file, REQUIRED when the NVMe
                 tier is used. Put it on a real drive — /tmp is often tmpfs
                 (RAM), which silently defeats the point. Deleted on
                 :meth:`close`.
    keep_activations :
                 backward strategy for :meth:`step`.
                 ``False`` (default, "recompute"): the training forward runs
                 under ``no_grad`` caching only chunk-boundary activations;
                 backward reloads each chunk and recomputes its forward
                 (per-chunk gradient checkpointing). Cheapest memory, but
                 every chunk's forward runs twice, and stochastic chunks
                 (dropout) would resample on recompute.
                 ``True`` ("keep"): the forward builds each chunk's autograd
                 graph and keeps its internal activations on the GPU, so
                 backward skips the recompute. Weights are STILL evicted:
                 the graph references stable weight tensor objects whose
                 storage is freed on eviction (``untyped_storage().resize_(0)``,
                 the FSDP resharding trick) and refilled by the loader
                 before that chunk's backward. Costs activation memory for
                 all chunks at once; also the correct mode for stochastic
                 chunks since nothing is resampled.
                 ``"checkpoint"``: keep-mode plumbing, but each chunk runs
                 under non-reentrant ``torch.utils.checkpoint`` — internal
                 activations are dropped and recomputed by autograd during
                 backward, with RNG stashed/restored. Recompute-cheap
                 memory AND dropout-safe (the mode recompute cannot be).
    offload_activations :
                 stream saved activations to pinned CPU RAM like weights
                 (``saved_tensors_hooks`` packets, one per chunk forward).
                 Policy is the simulator-validated *lazy* one: offload only
                 when more than ``act_slots`` chunk graphs are resident,
                 evict the packet whose backward is farthest, reload one
                 backward ahead. Requires ``keep_activations=True`` or
                 ``"checkpoint"`` (recompute mode already drops them).
                 With keep mode this bounds activation memory to
                 ~``act_slots`` chunks instead of all ``n``. Bit-exact:
                 the same values return at unpack. Never touches NVMe.
    act_slots  : resident chunk-activation packets allowed before the lazy
                 offload kicks in (default 2 — simulator sweet spot: one
                 in compute + one prefetched; raise it to trade GPU memory
                 for less PCIe traffic).
    nvme_io_backend : ``"auto"``/``"python"`` uses the portable bounded
                 pinned-buffer reader for NVMe masters. ``"aimdo"`` uses
                 AIMDO's native file-reader ring and is inference-only.
    residency_backend : ``"stream"`` is the normal CPU->GPU window.
                 ``"aimdo-vbar"`` is an experimental inference-only VBAR
                 cache; launch through ``ramtorch-aimdo`` before importing
                 PyTorch, because AIMDO must install its runtime first.

        ``grad_outputs``: grad-bypass escape hatch (mirrors the pipeline's).

        the last chunk's backward — either a tensor (or tuple aligned with
        a tuple output), or a callable ``(output, targets) -> grad`` that is

        Mixed precision: wrap the call in ``torch.autocast`` — everything
        (forward, backward recompute, loss) runs on the calling thread, so
        the ambient context applies; no engine support needed (unlike the

        kernel and memcpy — and write Chrome-trace JSON to this path. Drop
